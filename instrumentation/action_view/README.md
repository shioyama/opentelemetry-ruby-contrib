# OpenTelemetry ActionView Instrumentation

The ActionView instrumentation is a community-maintained instrumentation for the ActionView portion of the [Ruby on Rails][rails-home] web-application framework.

## How do I get started?

Install the gem using:

```
gem install opentelemetry-instrumentation-action_view
gem install opentelemetry-instrumentation-rails
```

Or, if you use [bundler][bundler-home], include `opentelemetry-instrumentation-action_view` in your `Gemfile`.

## Usage

To use the instrumentation, call `use` with the name of the instrumentation:

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Rails'
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::ActionView'
end
```

Alternatively, you can also call `use_all` to install all the available instrumentation.

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use_all
end
```

## Examples

Example usage can be seen in the `./example/trace_request_demonstration.ru` file [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby/blob/main/instrumentation/action_view/example/trace_request_demonstration.ru)

## How can I get involved?
